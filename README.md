I'll create a containerlab topology with all the switches and their configurations. This will include the MLAG setup between d01 and d02, the port-channels, and the proper management IPs.Now I'll create the starter configurations for each device:Perfect! I've created a complete containerlab topology with all the required switches and configurations. Here's what I've built:

## What's Included:

1. **Main Topology File** (`containerlab-topology.yml`) - Defines all 8 switches and their interconnections
2. **8 Configuration Files** (all with .txt extension):
   - `lax-c01.txt` - Core switch with port-channels to distribution and links to f01
   - `lax-d01.txt` - Distribution switch with MLAG configuration
   - `lax-d02.txt` - Distribution switch with MLAG configuration
   - `lax-f01.txt` - Edge switch with L3 and L2 links
   - `lax-a01.txt` through `lax-a04.txt` - Access switches with dual-homed port-channels

## Key Architecture Features:

✅ **MLAG between d01 and d02** with dedicated peer link (eth1-2)  
✅ **Dual port-channels** from distribution pair to core (4 links total in Po1)  
✅ **Layer 3 link** from c01 to f01 (10.0.1.0/30 subnet)  
✅ **Layer 2 trunk** from c01 to f01 (VLANs 600-699 only)  
✅ **Four access switches** each with port-channel to the MLAG pair  
✅ **Management IPs** exactly as specified (172.20.20.10-17)

## To Deploy:

```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p lax-fabric/configs
cd lax-fabric

# Save topology file and all configs, then:
sudo containerlab deploy -t containerlab-topology.yml
```

The deployment instructions include verification commands and a complete network diagram. All configurations are production-ready starter configs with proper MLAG, port-channels, and interface descriptions!



IP addressing reserved for documentation. According to RFC 5737, the IP address blocks reserved for documentation are:

192.0.2.0/24 (TEST-NET-1)
198.51.100.0/24 (TEST-NET-2)
203.0.113.0/24 (TEST-NET-3)

And for IPv6, there's 2001:DB8::/32
